Save a minimum of 3-6 months worth of liquid cash as an emergency fund. 2. If your employer offers a matching 401K then contribute up to at least the maximum amount they will match (it's free money). 3. Pay off any high interest debts you may have (credit cards, loans, etc.) and after you have accomplished all three, then we can speak about investing."}
